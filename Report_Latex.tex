\section{Introduction to React Native}
React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that allows developers to create mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Its primary advantage is the ability to develop apps for both iOS and Android platforms from a single codebase, significantly reducing development time and effort. This means you can write your application once and deploy it on both platforms, taking advantage of native performance and user experience.

\subsection{Key Features of React Native}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cross-Platform Compatibility:} Build applications that run seamlessly on both iOS and Android.
    \item \textbf{Hot Reloading:} Instantly see the results of changes made to your code, speeding up the development process.
    \item \textbf{Rich Ecosystem:} Access a wide range of libraries and components, making it easier to add complex functionalities.
\end{itemize}

        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{DeletedTask.jpeg}
        \caption{Deleting Task}
    \end{figure}
  
    
    \item \textbf{Scrollable Task List:} The to-do list supports scrolling, allowing navigation through a large number of tasks.

    \item \textbf{User-Friendly Interface:} The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing tasks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 1: Set Up the Project}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create and navigate to the new project:
    \begin{verbatim}
    npx react-native init SimpleTodoApp
    cd SimpleTodoApp
    \end{verbatim}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{SettingUpSimpleTodo.png}
        \caption{Setting up the To-Do List Project}
    \end{figure}
    
    \item Open the project in Visual Studio Code:
    \begin{verbatim}
    code .
    \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Step 2: Create the Basic To-Do List Structure}
Replace the content of \texttt{App.js} with the following code:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{InitialTodo.jpeg}
    \caption{Initial View of To-Do List}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Explanation of the Code}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State Management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \texttt{useState} hook is used to manage the state of the input field (task) and the list of tasks (tasks).
        \item When a new task is added, it updates the tasks array, and the input field is cleared.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Adding a Task}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \texttt{addTask} function checks if the input is not empty.
        \item It adds a new task with a unique ID (using the current timestamp) to the tasks array.
        \item The input field is then reset to an empty string.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Deleting a Task}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \texttt{deleteTask} function filters out the task with the specified ID from the tasks array.
        \item This updates the state and re-renders the list without the deleted task.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Rendering the List}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \texttt{FlatList} component efficiently renders the list of tasks.
        \item Each item in the list displays the task text and a delete button.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 4: Running the App}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In your terminal, run:
    \begin{verbatim}
    npx react-native run-android
    \end{verbatim}
    or
    \begin{verbatim}
    npx react-native run-ios
    \end{verbatim}
    \item This compiles and runs your app on the selected platform.

        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{RunningTodo.png}
        \caption{Running the To-Do List}
    \end{figure}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Submission (Total 60 Points)}
Provide detailed answers to the following questions, including any necessary screenshots:

\textbf{Extending Functionality (60 Points)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mark Tasks as Complete (15 Points)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Add a toggle function that allows users to mark tasks as completed.
        \item Style completed tasks differently, such as displaying strikethrough text or changing the text color.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{MarkTaskCompleted.jpeg}
            \caption{Task Marked as Complete}
        \end{figure}
     
        \item Explain how you updated the state to reflect the completion status of tasks.
        \item When a user toggles the completion status of a task, the state is updated by mapping over the tasks array and modifying only the relevant task. This triggers a re-render, and the UI reflects the updated status using the completed property.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Persist Data Using AsyncStorage (15 Points)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement data persistence so that tasks are saved even after the app is closed.
        \item Use AsyncStorage to store and retrieve the tasks list.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{AsyncStorage.png}
            \caption{AsyncStorage Code Snippet}
        \end{figure}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Edit Tasks (10 Points)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Allow users to tap on a task to edit its content.
        \item Implement an update function that modifies the task in the state array.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{EditTaskAnimation.jpeg}
            \caption{Editing Task in the To-Do List}
        \end{figure}

        \item Explain how you managed the UI for editing tasks.
        \item The UI for editing tasks is managed using state variables `isEditing` and `editTaskId`, which track whether a task is being edited and its ID. When a user clicks "Edit," the task's text populates the input field, and the tick mark button allows saving changes. The `addOrUpdateTask` function updates the task's text in the `tasks` state, resetting the editing state afterward. Conditional rendering dynamically switches the button from `+` to tick mark, while animations change the task's background color to green during editing for visual feedback. Once saved, the task reverts to its normal state, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Add Animations (10 Points)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use the \texttt{Animated} API from React Native to add visual effects when adding or deleting tasks.
        \item Describe the animations you implemented and how they enhance user experience.
             \item The animations implemented include a fade-out and slide-away effect for deleting tasks and a background color change to green for editing tasks. For deletion, the task's opacity gradually reduces to zero, while it slides out of the screen using `Animated.timing`, creating a smooth transition before removal. For editing, an animated background color change is achieved using `Animated.Value` and `interpolate`, transitioning from white to green to highlight the task being edited. These animations provide clear visual feedback, making interactions more intuitive and engaging by helping users easily identify actions like task deletion or editing in real time.

        \end{figure}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This report provides an overview of setting up a development environment for React Native, configuring an emulator, comparing development options, and building a simple To-Do List app with extended functionality. The setup allows for efficient app development, testing, and deployment on both emulators and physical devices.

\section{Acknowledgment of LLM Assistance}
